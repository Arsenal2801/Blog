    <p>Don't mix inorganic and organic trash</p>
    <p>The difference between inorganic and organic trash is how much time it spends to degrades in the Earth. That's te reasson we have to sepparet it, organic garbage sometime can be usefull to help in the nature, if we mix it with the inorganic garbage it won't be able to be used in the nature as it should be to help.</p>
