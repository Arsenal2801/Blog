    <p>Don't drop the water</p>
    <p>Water is a scarce and finite resource, is necessary for life. 71% of our earth is covered in water, only 3% of it is fresh water. Out of that 3%, only 1% is available, the remaining 2% being locked in glaciers and ice caps. WAter is not infinite as you can see now, that's the reason is important to less use water.</p>
